# Map-splat

This repo takes YAML data from the [RSE map
data](https://github.com/nordic-rse/map/) and puts it into nested list form for
the [Nordic RSE website](https://github.com/nordic-rse/nordic-rse.github.io) so
that e.g. people can get an estimate of how many RSEs there are in their
organisation and find out how to get into contact with them.
